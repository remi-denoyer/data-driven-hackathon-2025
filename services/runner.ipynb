A person who is accountable ultimately owns and stands by the decisions being made in their area of accountability. Being accountable doesn't mean being able to dictate decisions.\\n\\n\\n****Zoom on the Tech & Services Segment****\\n\\nThe Tech & Services segment is Alanâs historical core market and still represents today a significant share of our customer portfolio (~30%+ of the French business). It is also one of our most profitable segment and is therefore critical to the companyâs profitability plan\\n\\nWe have reached significant market share in the start-up & SaaS sub-segment and are building momentum in the consulting sub-segment. The key to future growth will be to (i) extend our reach in new sub-segments of the market (engineering & design offices, accounting, etc.) whilst (ii) finding ways to address the long tail of the tech & consulting sub-segments\\n\\nGiven the size of the customer portfolio a further challenge for this segment is to keep customers engaged and happy at Alan\\n\\nOver the next few years we will need to work on 3 main priorities\\n\\n* Keep acquiring market shares notably by focusing on under-pernetrated sub-segments\\n\\n* Maintain a high customer retention thanks to stellar service, innovative product differentiation & building strong relationships with key influencers\\n\\n* Keep optimizing our acquisition efficiency\\n\\n* **Generalist profile**, able to build a **360 view of their segment**, combining **business sense** and a strong understanding of **product considerations**\\n\\n* Prior experience **leading a business** (product category, business segment, etc.)\\n\\n* Exceptional **ability to communicate effectively** with senior leadership and align multiple stakeholders in a collaborative way \\n\\n* **Critical thinking**, **problem solving skills** and deep analytical rigor. Able to craft clear recommendations/strategies in spite of complexity/uncertainty\\n\\n* Ability to get their **hands dirty / self-starter**\\n\\n* Fluency in **English & French** (must-have)\\n\\n* At least 7 years of experience\",\n",

Mental health is still taboo: most people don&#39;t care, &quot;I don&#39;t have a mental health problem&quot;, and those who need help don&#39;t dare talk about it for fear of being labeled and set aside. However, with physical health, it is rooted in our habits. We are advised to eat well, to exercise regularly, we brush our teeth several times a day to avoid cavities. But what do we really do for our mental health on a daily basis? We at teale believe that you shouldn&#39;t wait until you have a problem to take care of your mental health. 1/ We start by talking loud and clear about mental health. By defining it, by explaining that no, it&#39;s not just the disease. Like physical health, it is also about well-being and performance And 2/ by providing a solution to those who are in need, but also by interesting others, to prevent everyone from slipping into illness. We believe that companies must be vectors of change. For this, we are creating a product that puts technology at the service of psychotherapy, to allow all employees to take care of their mental health on a daily basis. Let&#39;s take care of ourselves, let&#39;s talk about mental health with teale. www.teale.io',\n",
